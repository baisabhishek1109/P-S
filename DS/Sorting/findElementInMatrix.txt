#Write an algo to find an element from the matrix. Try to provided optimal way

Follow these steps while developing the logic :
	-> Move from worst to best case scenario
	-> Try to list down time and space complexity of all proposed methods
	
Given matrix:

		1	6	7	8	9	
		12	11	0	2	5	
		21	27	28	31	34
		16	18	19	24	29
		56	78	90	36	39

Try to find 19 in most optimal way?
